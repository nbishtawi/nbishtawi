# Hi there 👋 I'm Nadeem

I'm a Master's student in Data Science and Analytics at the University of Calgary with a background in biology. I’m especially interested in applying machine learning and statistical methods to health and biomedical data, and I enjoy working at the intersection of research, technology, and real-world impact.

I am currently researching RNA-sequencing and metabolomics integration in data science at Dr. Brent Winston's Metabolomics Lab. My academic path has been shaped by a curiosity for understanding complex systems and a drive to contribute to meaningful solutions in healthcare and public health.

I'm always looking to expand my skills, collaborate on thoughtful projects, and explore new tools and ideas in the data science space.

### 📚 Featured Projects

<details>
  <summary><strong>🎙️ Voice Cloning & Fake Audio Detection</strong></summary>

  This project involves building a system that clones voice samples using the TIMIT corpus and detects fake audio using machine learning classifiers.  
  Techniques used include audio preprocessing (`pydub`), spectrogram generation, and classification via PyTorch and XGBoost.  
  The pipeline supports speaker-to-speaker cloning and explores WER metrics for evaluation.  
  This project demonstrates applied work in synthetic speech and anti-spoofing detection.

  <summary><strong>🌫️ Air Quality in Alberta</strong></summary>

  This collaborative project explored how demographic and environmental factors correlate with Alberta's Air Quality Health Index (AQHI).  
  We used open data sources from the Alberta Government to analyze relationships between air quality, life expectancy, population size, and emissions.  
  Tools Python for visualization, and statistical analysis to detect long-term regional trends.

  <summary><strong>💊 Opioid Trends Post-Discharge</strong></summary>

  This project examined opioid prescribing patterns in patients following hospital discharge, using real-world administrative health data.  
  Key visualizations include class comparisons (e.g., opioids vs. NSAIDs/psychotropics), stratified bar charts, and jitter plots across diagnoses and age.  
  We aimed to highlight risks and inform better post-discharge opioid management, leveraging `ggplot2`, `treemap`, and tidyverse tools in R.

  <summary><strong>🩻 Chest X-ray Classification (DATA 622)</strong></summary>

  This deep learning project involved training a convolutional neural network using PyTorch to classify chest X-ray images into multiple diagnostic labels.  
  We explored different model architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet), fine-tuned hyperparameters using Optuna, and used SHAP for model explainability.  
  Evaluation metrics included micro-averaged AUC, F1, and accuracy across multilabel predictions.
