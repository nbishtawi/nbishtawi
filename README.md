# Hi there 👋 I'm Nadeem

I'm a Data Science and Analytics Master's student at the University of Calgary, with a background in biology and a passion for machine learning, health informatics, and research. My journey into data science was driven by my interest in uncovering meaningful insights from complex data—particularly in healthcare and bioinformatics.

I’ve worked on a variety of projects, including:
- Voice cloning & fake audio detection using the TIMIT corpus
- Reinforcement learning for CRM and marketing
- RNA-seq and metabolomic pathway integration
- ICU intervention dashboards and public health surveillance tools

I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate and learn something new.

### 📚 Featured Projects

<details>
  <summary><strong>🎙️ Voice Cloning & Fake Audio Detection</strong></summary>

  This project involves building a system that clones voice samples using the TIMIT corpus and detects fake audio using machine learning classifiers.  
  Techniques used include audio preprocessing (`pydub`), spectrogram generation, and classification via PyTorch and XGBoost.  
  The pipeline supports speaker-to-speaker cloning and explores WER metrics for evaluation.  
  This project demonstrates applied work in synthetic speech and anti-spoofing detection.

  <summary><strong>🌫️ Air Quality in Alberta</strong></summary>

  This collaborative project explored how demographic and environmental factors correlate with Alberta's Air Quality Health Index (AQHI).  
  We used open data sources from the Alberta Government to analyze relationships between air quality, life expectancy, population size, and emissions.  
  Tools Python for visualization, and statistical analysis to detect long-term regional trends.

  <summary><strong>💊 Opioid Trends Post-Discharge</strong></summary>

  This project examined opioid prescribing patterns in patients following hospital discharge, using real-world administrative health data.  
  Key visualizations include class comparisons (e.g., opioids vs. NSAIDs/psychotropics), stratified bar charts, and jitter plots across diagnoses and age.  
  We aimed to highlight risks and inform better post-discharge opioid management, leveraging `ggplot2`, `treemap`, and tidyverse tools in R.

  <summary><strong>🩻 Chest X-ray Classification (DATA 622)</strong></summary>

  This deep learning project involved training a convolutional neural network using PyTorch to classify chest X-ray images into multiple diagnostic labels.  
  We explored different model architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet), fine-tuned hyperparameters using Optuna, and used SHAP for model explainability.  
  Evaluation metrics included micro-averaged AUC, F1, and accuracy across multilabel predictions.
